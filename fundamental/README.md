### The fundamental before solving leetcode problem. 


I have been try to solve leetcode problems. many attempts. but failed every time. 

Then I googled, to see if I am actually so stupid to solve thoes problems, I ran into this video [How I would learn Leetcode if I could start over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHZW7TuY_yo). He has mentioned that leetcode is hard for everyone, (unless you are a genius) you should internalize some basic concepts such as binary search, dfs(depth-first search), bfs(Breadth-first search), and sliding windows. it is like you teach a kid how to use, addition, substraction, multiplication, division. No mater how hard you try to teach, how well the kid understand the operation, they will always not be able to solve simple calculation unless they practice thoes operation.
